# The Maze
* This is a fun little puzzle!
* I hope you enjoy it!

* This is meant to be played by using the binary without knowing what it is doing.

* Of course you can check the code, but playing without checking the code is nicer!
* Build with go
```sh
go build -o maze main.go
```
* Play
```
./maze
```
